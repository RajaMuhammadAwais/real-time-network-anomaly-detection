# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This project uses a Contributor License Agreement to ensure contributions can be distributed under the projectâ€™s open-source license.

- First-time contributors will be prompted by the CLA Assistant bot in their pull request to sign the CLA electronically.
- You only need to sign once per GitHub account.
- The CLA confirms you have the right to submit the contribution and grants us the necessary rights to distribute it.

If you have questions about the CLA, please open an issue labeled "question" and a maintainer will assist.
