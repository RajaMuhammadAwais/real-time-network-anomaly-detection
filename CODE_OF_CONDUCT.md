# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free community.

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Assume good intent; seek to understand before responding.
- Provide constructive feedback; avoid personal attacks.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, discrimination, or any form of abuse. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Report privately to the maintainers via the security/support contact listed in SECURITY.md or by opening a confidential channel if available.
- Provide as much context as possible.

Consequences may include warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the community spaces.

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces and when representing the project in public.
